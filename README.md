# Denneth's Fantabulous ASCII Game Compendium #1
 
So, I was bored, and wanted to do some C# programming.
Here are some of the results.
Mainly:
- Tic Tac Toe (or naughts and crosses)
- 4 in a row
- Hangman

As I strive to do with all my software, for ill defined reasons, they too are uploaded to github.
